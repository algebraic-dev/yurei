; Algebraic data type of sum, they're like enums but can hold data.
(data (Maybe a)
  (Just a)
  (Nothing))

; Records are like structs, they store multiple data at once and create some functions that can access that data inside User namespace.
(record User
  (name String)
  (age Int))

; Algebraic effects and effect handlers will alsobe available to isolate kinds of side effects and improve the handling of them.
(effect IO
  (print (-> String Unit)))

(doc main \"The entrypoint of the program\")
